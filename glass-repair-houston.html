                <h2>You Don't Always Need to Replace the Entire Window</h2>
                <p>Many homeowners assume that a foggy, moisture-filled, or cracked window means they need a costly <a href="/services/energy-efficient-window-replacement-houston.html" class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold hover:underline">full-frame replacement</a>. In most cases, that's not true. If your window frames are still in good condition, our expert technicians can solve the problem by professionally replacing only the insulated glass unit (IGU).</p>
                <p>This targeted approach is the most cost-effective way to restore your window's performance, safety, and clarity, saving you significant time and money.</p>

                        <h3>Is Your View Ruined by Foggy Glass?</h3>
                        <p>That milky, hazy appearance or condensation between the panes means the airtight seal on your double-pane window has failed. This allows moisture to get in, ruining your view and eliminating the window's insulating properties. Our solution is simple: we remove the old, failed glass unit and install a brand new, perfectly sealed one into your existing frame.</p>
