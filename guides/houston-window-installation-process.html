                <p class="text-xl">The single biggest difference between a window that lasts a decade and one that lasts a lifetime is the quality of the installation. It’s the area where most companies cut corners to offer a lower price. We believe the installation is the most critical part of the entire project, and we've built our reputation on doing it the right way, without compromise.</p>
                
                <h2>The Critical Difference: Why Our Method is Superior</h2>
                <p>When you get quotes, you'll encounter two very different installation methods. Understanding this is key to knowing why our price reflects a fundamentally better, more permanent solution.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-800 mt-0">The Shortcut: "Insert" Installations</h3>
                        <p class="text-slate-600">This common method involves placing a smaller window inside your old frame. It's faster and cheaper, but you lose glass area, and it relies on fillers to cover gaps. Crucially, it fails to address any potential rot or damage hidden within your walls. It's a patch, not a solution.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-green-800 mt-0">The Right Way: Our Full-Frame Method</h3>
                        <p class="text-slate-600">We perform a full-frame replacement. We remove the old frame entirely, allowing us to inspect the opening and address any issues. This maximizes your glass area and ensures a perfect, permanent, weatherproof seal directly to your home's structure, just like in a new construction.</p>

                <h2>Our Step-by-Step Installation Process</h2>
                <p>Our process is designed for precision, quality, and respect for your home.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Consultation & Exterior Measurement</h3>
                <p>It starts with a detailed consultation. We measure your window openings from the <strong>outside</strong> to ensure the new, full-frame window is custom-built to the exact size of the rough opening. This guarantees the strongest possible fit without the need for excessive fillers.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Protecting Your Home</h3>
                <p>On installation day, our first priority is your home. Our professional crew lays down protective drop cloths and coverings both inside and outside the work area. We treat your home with the care it deserves.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: The "Cut Back" Method for a Perfect Fit</h3>
                <p>After removing the entire old window and frame, we address the challenge of modern windows. New, energy-efficient frames are often thicker in depth than older ones. To ensure a perfect, flush fit, our skilled installers will <strong>"cut back" the interior sheetrock</strong> around the window opening when required. This extra step is critical—it allows the new, thicker frame to sit perfectly within the wall, just as it would in a new construction home.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Setting, Insulating, and Sealing</h3>
                <p>With the opening prepared, we set, level, and shim the new window for a perfect fit. We then apply a low-expansion insulating foam into the gap between the window and the house frame. This creates a complete thermal barrier, stopping drafts and energy loss. Finally, we apply a professional-grade exterior sealant for a permanent, weatherproof seal.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Finishing & Meticulous Cleanup</h3>
                <p>The final step is the finish work. We install new interior trim for a beautiful, clean look that seamlessly integrates the window into your wall. After a final inspection, we clean our entire work area, including vacuuming any dust and hauling away your old windows. We leave your home looking better than when we arrived.</p>
